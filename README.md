# WSU_GoBabyGo_Programming
Here are all of the .ino files we have created within WSU-GoBabyGo!. Here we can collaborate to make sure that working programs can be made available to the GoBabyGo! world.

noMD = no motor driver module/library was used.

AnalogJoystick = a joystick that uses 2 potentiometers to output a value based upon its location on the x and y axis. Using an Analog input to read these values will allow you to assign digital outputs based upon these values.

DigitalJoystick = a joystick that uses 4 or 8 momentary switched (on/off) to open or close a switch/pin. Using a digital input to read this as a High or Low will allow you to assign digital outputs based upon the state of your inputs.

headarray = utilizing anaolog or digital switches that can be activated by small amounts of force to output an analog of digital value. Using these signals you can assign outputs.

10kPot_Steering_Feedback = using a 10k potentiometer to track the value of the steering shaft. By affixing the steering pot to read the value of the steering shaft, you can track its location. This in turn allows you to create target values that will allow for you to return the steering shaft back to the center. This is a $0.10 method of accomplishing the task of an encoder.
